## About This Project
This is the API design project mandated by the EEE3097S course at UCT, created by William Bourn and Declan Molloy, to demonstrate the use of IoT technology in a particular field
of work. For this project, it was decided that security and remote access would be the focus and, thus, this API was designed for use with the EOZ IP40 keypad and RS Pro 105N
Lock.

## Licence
See LICENCE for details.

## Contributing

```sh
git init
```
Perform a pull request from the directory url.
```sh
git pull https://github.com/WilliamBourn/EEE3097S-API-Design-Project.git
